## 📌 项目名称 | Project Title  
**Comparative Evaluation of VAE and GAN on Fashion-MNIST**

### 📆 Duration  
April – May 2025

### 📚 Course  
EECE 7397 – Advanced Machine Learning, Northeastern University

### 🎯 Objective  
This project aims to compare the performance of two generative models—VAE and GAN—on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The goal was to explore their ability to learn latent representations and synthesize realistic images, using FID score as the primary evaluation metric.

### 🔧 Technologies  
Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
Models: VAE, GAN  
Evaluation: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)

### 🧠 My Contributions  
- Led model implementation and architecture tuning for both VAE and GAN  
- Applied reparameterization tricks in VAE and stabilized GAN training  
- Conducted comparative evaluation and analysis using FID  
- Designed and delivered the final presentation  
- Documented model performance and visual results

### 📈 Results  
- VAE FID score: **53.26** (smoother but blurrier)  
- GAN FID score: **21.33** (sharper and more detailed)
